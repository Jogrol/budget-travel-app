# Goals for this project:

# Requirements
Travel Budget App.
The idea is based on personal frustration. 
I like to go on trips and I like to keep track of my expenses but the available apps in the Google Play Store or Apple Store are over complicated and not user friendly. 
The app should be innovative and playful. Creating a budget and keep track of your spendings for your trip should be fun!

## My agile workflow and Trello board
I try to maintain a backlog even though I'm working on a project by myself. That way people can quickly jump in and start helping out. It also displays how I split up my tasks and try to build this project in an iterative and incremental way!
